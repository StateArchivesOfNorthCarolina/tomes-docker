# TOMES Docker

This Docker application provides access to an earlier subset of the [TOMES project repositories](https://github.com/StateArchivesOfNorthCarolina?utf8=âœ“&q=tomes&type=public&language=) as a web application.

This application was created for in-project demonstration. As of December 2018, it is not known to work in Windows. Please use the native Python/command-line tools available from the individual repositories for updated, cross-platorm functionality.

For more information and setup/usage documentation, see the [TOMES project documentation](https://github.com/StateArchivesOfNorthCarolina/tomes-project).
