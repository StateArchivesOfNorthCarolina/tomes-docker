# TOMES Docker

This Docker application provides access to an earlier subset of the [TOMES project repositories](https://github.com/StateArchivesOfNorthCarolina?utf8=âœ“&q=tomes&type=public&language=) as a web application.

This application was created for in-project demonstration. As of December 2018, it is not known to work in Windows. Please use the native Python/command-line tools available from the individual repositories for updated, cross-platform functionality.

Interested Linux users should see the [tomes-project](https://github.com/StateArchivesOfNorthCarolina/tomes-project) repository for more information on setup/usage.
